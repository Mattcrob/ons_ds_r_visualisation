# ons_ds_r_visualisation

Have an RMarkdown file that shows the "Static" reports and then replicate this in RShiny.


## Raw Data
81 features, Chat GPT knows of 79 (1 is order so need to find last one)


## Initial Ideas
+ Using the RShiny dropdowns allow the user to plot different data on the axes as per the Movie Explorer example: https://gallery.shinyapps.io/051-movie-explorer/
+ sliders on key attributes like plot area
+ Showcase data updating abilities -> implement a "refresh" button that demo's atleast the data could be updated if needed.
+ Plot Neighborhood onto Ames map with key features like house price etc.
